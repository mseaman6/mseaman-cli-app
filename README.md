Library Events CLI App

The Library Events CLI app scrapes data from the DC Public Library page.  The user is greeted and asked to either see a listing of the events, or to exit the program.  Upon selecting 'events', a numbered list of library events, along with their times, is displayed for the user.  The user can then select the number of any event to get a more detailed description of the event, or choose to exit.
