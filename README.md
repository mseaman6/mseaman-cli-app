Library Events CLI App

The Library Events CLI app scrapes data from the DC Public Library page.  The user is greeted and asked to either see a listing of the events, or to exit the program.  Upon selecting 'events', a numbered list of library events, along with their times, is displayed for the user.  The user can then select the number of any event to get a more detailed description of the event, or choose to exit.

## Install Instructions

To utilize the Library Events CLI App, please feel free to clone, or fork and clone, the app from GitHub at https://github.com/'mseaman6'/mseaman-cli-app.  Once you have selected the clone or download option in green on the right side of the page, select the Clone with SSH option, and click the clipboard to save that information.  Then open up your local environment and enter `git clone <saved url>`.  The Library Events CLI folder should then be made available.  You should then `cd <directory name>` into that folder.  To run the program you would then enter `ruby bin/run` into your terminal, to run the executable file.  The terminal will then direct you through the Library Events CLI app functionality.
